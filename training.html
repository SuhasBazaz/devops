<title>About Training</title>

To start with giving my comments on training, I was in his Linux training and it was really good, got to learn many new things which can be used in my development phase.

<p>Now, about the training on devops,it's going really well and as always there's ample amount of time for hands-on which is the best part in Mayank's training</p>
